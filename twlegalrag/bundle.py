"""Build a retrieval bundle for use with any external AI tool.

A *bundle* is a self-contained JSON package the user can hand to ChatGPT /
Claude / Gemini / a local model. It carries the retrieved judgments, stable
citation ids (J1, J2, ...), full-text excerpts, and an explicit set of
verification instructions telling the downstream model to cite only what is in
the bundle and to mark unsupported propositions as unverified.

This is retrieval-only. The bundle does not contain an answer and makes no
claim about the faithfulness of any answer later generated from it.
